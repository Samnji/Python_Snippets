# Python_Snippets
These are code snippets for simple problems with python 
that touches through across all topics from simple to expert topics.
In the PYTHONCODES directory there is a file named the same as the directory,
it is a composition of many codes in that file 
and can be splited into various files 
using a certain file name "# Python file split into many files.py".
I would recommend someone to download those 2 files if interested with those all codes faster.
